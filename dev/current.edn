 :notes "Added comprehensive Bifrost error handling:
- 429 rate limit errors → returned as 429 with proper error type
- 500 server errors → returned as 502 bad gateway
- Timeouts → caught and returned as 504 gateway timeout
- All errors properly formatted for both SSE and JSON modes
- 3 new tests added (test-bifrost-rate-limit, test-bifrost-server-error, test-bifrost-timeout)
- All 15 tests passing (7 integration + 8 bifrost shim)
- Zero lint warnings"
